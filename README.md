Regression Project 1-Predicting red wine quality involves analyzing various factors that contribute to its overall character and taste. Factors such as grape variety, alcohol content, acidity, and residual sugar play crucial roles in determining the quality of red wine. Machine learning models can be trained on historical data to recognize patterns and correlations between these factors and the perceived quality . By inputting these features into a predictive model, it can generate insights into the potential quality of a red wine.

Classification Project 2-Analyzing a hepatitis dataset to predict whether individuals lived or died based on various health parameters is a critical task in healthcare. Factors such as age, gender, serum bilirubin levels,prothrombin time and many more are instrumental in assessing the severity of hepatitis and the likelihood of survival. Machine learning models can be trained on this dataset to identify patterns and relationships between these variables and the ultimate outcome of the patients. By leveraging predictive analytics, healthcare professionals can gain valuable insights into the prognosis of individuals affected by hepatitis. Such models contribute significantly to the field of medical research and personalized medicine, fostering a more targeted and effective approach to managing hepatitis cases.
